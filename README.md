# ReinforcedAgent
Java implementation of reinforcement learning algorithms based on book of A. Barto and R. S. Sutton.

Implementation includes following algorithms:
- Sarsa,
- Q-learning,
- Sarsa(lambda),
- Watkins's Q(lambda)
and e-greedy policy with some modifications.

Algorithms work in RL-Library envirounments (was tested on Mountain Car and CartPole problems).

It collaborates with rl-viz library: creates GUI interface on RLVizApp (main window - pre selection and 
configuration of agent) and on Agent Visualizer (control during experiment).
